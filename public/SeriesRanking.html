<h1>The Best series I've ever seen!!!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Netflix Series of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>- I really love this series because the main character, whose name is Scofield, was very intelligent.
     He tattooed his back like a blueprint with the entire prison layout just to save his brother from execution.
</p>
<h3>Money Heist</h3>
<p>- I love this series because it shows the plan for the entire heist: how they can steal the money from the government, 
    how they manage to escape without being traced by the police, and how the characters are named after cities around the world, such as Tokyo and Manila.
</p>
<h3>Start-Up</h3>
<p>- This K-drama series focuses on self-growth, business, and technology, and how the characters became successful because of their hard work. It's highly 
    recommended for people who are into business and the IT industry.
